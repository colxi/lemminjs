# lemminjs

LemminJS is a clone of the LemmingsÂ® classic game (by DMA Design), implemented using Javascript (ES6).

The objective in this personal project is to achieve a functional full-playable game, with some modern extra capabilities implemented (viewport zoom, cross device, reponsive UI, touch input...), using my personal game engine (Jstick).

> In development!

> Note : The original DMA Design Sprites and Maps artwork are used in this project, until it reaches an advanced development stage, and are reeplaced by custom artwork.
